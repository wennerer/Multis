# Multis - This is a package with components created for Lazarus
The components are characterized by the fact that they have many user-defined properties and their appearance is almost the same on different OS.
I developed and tested it under Linux Mint 64bit. I compiled it under Windows 64 and 32 bit, Linux 32 bit, Linux with qt and FreeBSD.
