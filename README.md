# Multis - This is a package with components created for Lazarus
The package currently contains:    
-TMultiButton, a button with an integrated messagebutton   
-TMultiButtonStylemanager, makes it easier to manage the properties when using several MultiButtons   
-TMultiplexSlider, a slider with up to 3 knobs    
-TMultiSeperator, just an optical element in the look of the multis. To be used between controls.   
-TMultiPanel, a panel that can appear and disappear and it can expand and collapse like a hamburger menu.   
-TMultiLayer, this component provides a page that can also be made invisible at design time.      
-TMultiRadioGroup, you can set many colours and you can link several MultiRadioGroups with each other.    
-TMultiCheckGroup, you can set many colours and you can link several MultiCheckGroups with each other.     
The components are characterized by the fact that they have many user-defined properties and their appearance is almost the same on different OS.     
I developed and tested it under Linux Mint 64bit. I compiled it under Windows 64 and 32 bit, Linux 32 bit, Linux with qt and FreeBSD.

In the help directory there is a small description of the components contained in the package (in English and German).    
When installing the package you get the possibility to create a new menu entry in the help menu of the Lazarus IDE.    
This can be used to call up the help file.
